A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the data-set and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. Decision Trees :  Decision trees are simple but intuitive models that utilize a top-down approach in which the root node creates binary splits until a certain criteria is met. This binary splitting of nodes provides a predicted value based on the interior nodes leading to the terminal (final) nodes. In a classification context, a decision tree will output a predicted target class for each terminal node produced.
